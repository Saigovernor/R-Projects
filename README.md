## **Staying Caffeinated: Customer Retention Strategies for a Coffee Store** 

### **Introduction**

Coffee House is a multinational chain of coffeehouses and roastery reserves. They have observed dwindling customer retention rates and revenue, therefore there's a need to conduct an analysis into the causes of this, which I have done in this project. 

### **Project Objectives** 

1. Cleaning and preparing the given dataset for analysis using R.

2. Explore data to identify trends and patterns.

3. Model data using statistics to identify factors contributing to retention rates.

4. Developing solutions to the given problem statement in the light of your data insights using visualizations.
